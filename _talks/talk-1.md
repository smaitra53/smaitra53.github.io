The advent of Internet of Things (IoT) has brought about a new horizon in the field of pervasive computing and network-oriented systems. IoT has enabled everyday "things" to communicate with each other, exchange information and perform tasks more efficiently in terms of power and resources while requiring minimum human intervention. As the application scope of IoT is tremendously vast, the integration of heterogeneous objects or "things" in an IoT system is a challenging task. 

In this talk, I explain how heterogeneous sensor modules can be implemented and deployed. These modules are battery powered, small portable packages that acquire environmental data from various sensors and publish the information to several IoT cloud platforms for analysis and visualization.
