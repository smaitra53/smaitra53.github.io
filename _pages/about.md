I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. degree at [Bradley Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Virginia Tech](https://ece.vt.edu/) under the guidance of [Dr. Angelos Stavrou](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=hnuQ6PMAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Dr. Haining Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=tmOInzMAAAAJ&hl=en).

I am interested in developing and implementing hw/sw assisted secure computing frameworks for cellular applications. Broadly, my area of expertise includes trusted computing, embedded security, and cyber-physical systems.

Before joining Virgina Tech, I received my MS in Engineering from [Central Michigan University](https://www.cmich.edu/academics/colleges/college-science-engineering/departments-schools/school-of-engineering-and-technology) and my B.Sc. in Electrical and Electronic Engineering from [AUST](https://www.aust.edu/eee), Bangladesh.
